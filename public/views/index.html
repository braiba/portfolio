        My name is Thomas Bickley and I am a software developer based in Sheffield. The majority of my professional
        experience with various PHP and JavaScript frameworks, but I have also worked on projects in Java and Go. I also
        have extra-professional experience with a wide range of other languages (see my <a href="#/cv">CV</a> or the
        <a href="#/projects">projects section</a> for more details).
