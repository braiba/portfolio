        My name is Thomas Bickley and I am a software developer based in Sheffield.

        I take pride in not only learning best practices, but also understanding the reasoning behind them, in order to
        ensure they are used to their fullest potential in making my code maintainable, reusable and extendable. I also
        strive to provide the best user experience with every aspect of the work I do, from the clarity of front-end
        interfaces to the responsiveness of back-end API calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        The majority of my professional experience is with various PHP and JavaScript frameworks, but I have also worked
        on projects in Java and Go. In addition to this, I also have lots of extra-professional experience with a wide
        range of other languages (see my <a href="#/cv">CV</a> or the <a href="#/projects">projects section</a> for more
        details).
